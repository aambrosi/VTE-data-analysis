# Data Analysis and Exploration: a research project on Venous Thromboembolism

Dataset and description are available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE48000

## Abstract
This project is based on the study "Whole blood gene expression profiles distinguish clinical phenotypes of venous thromboembolism" of Deborah A. Lewis, Sunil Suchindran, Michele G. Beckman, W. Craig Hooper, Althea M. Grant et al. published on Thrombosis Research in 2015.
The goal of the project is to use the dataset provided by the aforementioned research and apply models of machine learning to understand if there is the possibility of predict conditions of venous thromboembolism based on gene expression.
